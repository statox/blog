   - This is a template I created when I changed the URI of all the posts from
   -  /posts/category/post-name
   -  to
   -  /posts/year/date/post-name
   - to avoid breaking links I already posted online.
   - 
   - It reads the data in src/_data/redirections.json and for each item creates
   - a page which redirect from the old URI to the new one

    I know <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool URIs don't change</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    But I started this site without thinking too much of URIs and here I am with a clunky system that I need to evolve.
    In theory this page should redirect you to the new url.

    If it doesn't try to go directly on <a href="." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.statox.fr.</a>
    and if that is still not the right page please <a href="https://www.statox.fr/social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drop me a message</a>.
