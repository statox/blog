<h2>Generating a maze... and then solving it</h2>

<p>Quick, no time to explain! Have a look at how a computer goes out of a maze <a href="https://statox.github.io/p5-maze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the demo</a>!</p>
<p>And check out <a href="https://github.com/statox/p5-maze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> if you want to see the code.</p>
<h3>Getting out of the maze</h3>
<p>Solving mazes is not a new topic, every computer science student heard about this topic at least once during their studies and most of them tried to implement a maze solver one way or another. However seeing a computer getting out of a maze is always a source of wonder and excitement to me. I know there is nothing magical in these maze solving algorithms but seeing them getting executed has always been some kind of a kink to me.</p>
<p>So last time I had a bit of free time I decided to make my own maze solver! It's nothing fancy: I'm not inventing a new algorithm nor am I looking for something extremely fast but I wanted it to be fun to watch.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://statox.github.io/p5-maze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is</a> what I came up with.</p>
<h3>Run and fight</h3>
<p>I had two main goals in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to visualize different algorithms solving the same maze at the same time. This would be what I call an AI fight.</li>
<li>Being able to generate a maze. Firstly because without a maze it's useless to have a solver, but also because I wanted to compare different ways to generate a maze.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I used p5.js again to create a grid of cells and destroy the walls between them to create ways. The web application allows to choose the classical backtracking solution as well as a recursive divisor generator. This is not fancy but this works.</p>
<p>However, doing some researched I also discovered that some cellular automata generate patterns looking like a maze, namely CA <code>B3/S12345</code> and <code>B3/S1234</code> (meaning a cell is born if it has exactly 3 alive neighbors and it survives it is has respectively 1,2,3,4 or 5 and 1,2,3 or 4 alive neighbors). The web app also allows to select this generators and even though I had to cheat a bit (sometimes some walls need to be broken to have a valid maze) it was quite exciting to see CAs applied on mazes!</p>
<p>About the solvers so far I implemented four of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The depth first search and breadth first search algorithms: Classical and not really surprising.</li>
<li>The wall follower: This one is the less efficient of all but, given there is not island in a maze it will always find the exit. This one is cool because it can easily be applied in the real world.</li>
<li>The Euristic approach: This one is based on a very smart euristic I chose myself and which can be summed up like this: Between the four next possible cells, choose the one the closest to the exit. To my surprise it works reasonably well but I suspect this is because my mazes are not complex enough.</li>
</ul>
