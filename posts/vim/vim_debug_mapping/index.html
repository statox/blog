<h2>How to debug a mapping before asking for help on the internet</h2>

<p>After participating on <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vi.stackexchange</a> for a few years as well as lurking <a href="https://reddit.com/r/vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/r/vim</a> I noticed that creating mappings in Vim is not completely trivial for a new user.</p>
<p>As Vim has been my favorite text editor since around 2015 I really enjoy helping new users getting more comfortable with it and creating their config just the way they want. That's why I read and answered quite a few questions about Vim mappings. Eventually, I noticed some recurring patterns and decided that I wanted to address the most common errors. To do so I wrote a generic question on vi.stackexchange and tried to explain the root causes of the most common issues when one creates a mapping in vim.</p>
<p>It was fun to write but it is also pretty satisfying to see that this is my most read and upvoted answer! I believe that as long as new people will learn to use Vim these issues will still need to be addressed and I hope that what this post will do.</p>
<p>I think in the future I'll try to make an actual blog post about that maybe digging on more exotic edge cases.</p>
<p>But for now, this is a link I have sent to a lot a new vimmers and it seems to have been helpful to some of them: <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/7722/1841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to debug a mapping?</a></p>
