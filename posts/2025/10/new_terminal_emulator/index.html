I found a few Github issue where he seems to have strong opinion and be not very welcoming to suggestions</li><li>The copy past mode delegated to an external pager is very annoying. There is a Neovim plugin to use it as a pager, I'm not a fan of adding things to my editor config because my terminal can't handle selecting text.</li></ul><h2 id="wezterm" tabindex="-1">Wezterm <a class="header-anchor" href="#wezterm">ðŸ”—</a></h2><ul><li>Install via flatpak, dedicated apt repo or appimage (if installed via appimage need to create an entry in my app launcher)</li><li>Most of the icons of <code>:NvimWebDeviconsHiTest</code> are supported and gets a notification when some glyph can't be found in any font</li><li>Config file autoreload + config in lua</li><li>Managed to get the space screen space as tmux (Disabling &quot;fancy tab bar&quot; makes it even better than tmux)</li><li>The docs are really not clear<ul><li>~I didn't find a simple way to test lua commands interactively with the cli or to use what I did in cli in the lua conf~ <code>ctrl+shift+l</code> opens the debug layout which gives a lua repl</li><li>Using colorschemes isn't clear at first and seem to require running lua code</li></ul></li><li>Colorschemes:<ul><li>Good my nvim themes *fox are available</li><li>Dimming inactive tabs works out of the box</li></ul></li></ul><p>Issues to solve:</p><ul><li>[x] Because of the autoreload of the config file and invalid config causes an error and I need a different terminal emulator to fix the config file. It keeps open the window with the previous config.</li><li>Apparently there are no layouts, so my tmux <code>leader+n</code> doesn't work out of the box. It seems to be possible to reimplement with custom lua functions</li><li>It looks like I can't center the tab bar show it's not as good visually as tmux</li><li>I have to setup LSP lua to work in config file to get a better discoverability of the available configs.</li><li>Espanso doesn't seem to work out of the box</li></ul><p>Issue to solve?</p><ul><li>At one point the whole UI became very slow, I'm not sure if its also affected other apps. I'm trying to disable nvim plugin render-markdown but I'm not sure it's really related.<ul><li>The issue comes from the interference with <code>picom</code>. I disabled the composer and it seems to solve the performance issue, but I don't have window transparency anymore. I might dig more but also I might also ditch picom completely.</li></ul></li></ul>
