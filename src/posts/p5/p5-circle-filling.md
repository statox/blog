title: Circle filling algorithm (with kittens)
---

Inspired by a video of The Coding Train on Youtube I implemented a circle filling thing!

Here we loop through a few pictures of kittens and pop cirlces on them until a percentage of their surface is covered.

A [demo](https://statox.github.io/p5-circles/) and [the code](https://github.com/statox/p5-circles)
