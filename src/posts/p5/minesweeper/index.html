title: Including a p5.js project in this website (Minesweeper ðŸ’£)
commentIssueId: 11
---

<p>
The first posts I wrote on this site and which were about p5.js applications are based on code that I wrote before creating the site. As I already hosted the applications on their own Github pages it was easier to simply have a link to these pages in the posts. For example check my <a href="{{ '../p5-cellular-automaton/' | url }}">cellular automata post</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now that this site is created I wanted to see how I could integrate a p5.js application directly in its pages. This is now done with this simple minesweeper demo. It didn't required a lot of work other than adding a call to a cdn in the post source to get p5.js and updating my <code>.eleventy.js</code> to add <code>.js</code> files to the list of template files to compile.
</p>
<p>
For now I am happy with this test but there are still a few things I'd like to test:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check how to put this kind on posts in their own Github repo and add them to the site's source code as git submodules</li>
    <li>Check how I can integrate a framework like Vue.js to avoid having to create my own <code>interface.js</code> with some ugly functions to update the UI and send the data to the p5.js sketch</li>
    <li>Investigate how to make this kind of demo more mobile friendly because for now it clearly doesn't work on a touch screen</li>
</ul>

<h2>The minesweeper</h2>

<p>
To create this first p5.js integrated demo I wanted something simple to code which I could have running pretty fast. Recreating a minesweeper has several advantages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>This is a well known game which wouldn't require me to do some research on how to make its UI or which corner cases rules exist.</li>
    <li>It includes a kind of maze solving algorithm to automatically open the cells clicked when they are not near a mine. And I <em>love</em> this kind of algorithm, even though this one is fairly short and simple.</li>
    <li>It is a nice way to prepare a future project of creating a minesweeper on an hexagonal grid. Actually that was my initial project but I realized that it's not as trivial as I would have expected and thus it would be better to make it a completely seperated project.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are still a number of features I'd like to implement even in this squared grid minesweeper like having a deterministic grid (i.e. not having cases where the user has to choose a cell randomly), having cells with several mines to make it a bit harder to play, adding a zoom feature to be able to have larger grids or even creating an AI which would open the cases based on probabilities... But for now that's a nice little demo, even though I must admit that it was more fun to create it than to play with it (because personally I find minesweeper to be a terribly boring game!)
