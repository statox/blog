My current TODO list of my ideas of projects

TODO:

- A simple way to edit this file from my phone. (Maybe using github issues or maybe with a simple `.htaccess`)
- A simple breathing exercises application. It could start simply with a cronjob to do 3 reminders a day and then a webpage or a bash script using xdialog to start a 5 minutes counter. It could do a light bip at the beginning and end of the 5 minutes so that you can close your eyes.
- A blogpost about the new vim9 script.

DONE:
