Cellular automaton are cool! 

Depsite the fact that I never remember which spelling is singular or plural (automaton? automata? automat[a|on]s??) these mathematical concepts have been fascinating me for a long time.
When I heard that John Conway, the creator of the Game of life, passed away I decided to create this simulation hoping to get some cool visuals.

The [demonstration](https://statox.github.io/p5-cellular-automaton/) is hosted on the github pages of the project and the source code is [here on Github](https://github.com/statox/p5-cellular-automaton)
