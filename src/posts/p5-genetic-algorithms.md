This was my beginning with P5.js and I wanted to play with genetic algorithms.

So I made a lot of square shaped roomba robots and tried to make them explore their universe... I think my implementation might be buggy because they don't seem that clever.

The fun here was to play with a library to create some visualizations on the statistics.

Still [the demo](https://statox.github.io/p5-genetics/) is fun to watch and [the code](https://github.com/statox/p5-genetics)... well it's ugly, but free.
