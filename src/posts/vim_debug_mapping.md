title: How to debug a mapping
---

After participating on [vi.stackexchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/) for a few years as well as lurking [/r/vim](https://reddit.com/r/vim) I noticed that creating mappings in Vim is not completely trivial.

After answering quite a few questions I noticed some recurring patterns and decided that I wanted to address the most common errors. To do so I wrote a generic question on vi.stackexchange and tried to explain the root causes of the most common issues when one creates a mapping in vim.

I think in the future I'll try to make an actual blog post about that but still this post could be useful to some new vimmers.

But for now, this is a link I have sent to a lot a new vimmers and it seems to have been helpful to some of them: [How to debug a mapping?](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/7722/1841)
