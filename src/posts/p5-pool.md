Inspired by the amazing video series "The Coding Nature" by Daniel Shiftman on Youtube I created a pool game. 

It is ugly and doesn't work well, but it was pretty fun to implement some kind of unholy physic engine for the first time!

A [demo](https://statox.github.io/p5-pool/) is available online and the code is [on Github](https://github.com/statox/p5-pool)
