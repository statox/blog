title: GOD.vim - Quote the help
---

This is a plugin I made to simplify the way one can quote Vim's help online.
Participating on [vi.stackexchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com) I like to reference the help topics I used when I wrote an answer and I wanted a command which would behave just like `:h` but would
also put in my clipboard a link to the used help topic on online help websites like http://vimhelp.appspot.com/.

So I wrote [GOD.vim](https://github.com/statox/GOD.vim) which does just that.
