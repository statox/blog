title: California dreamin' - Baby Huey vs. The Mamas & The Papas
---

Baby Huey and his band took one of the best songs ever written and turned it into a majestic piece of instrumental music. They used the same kind of flute which makes the solo of the original song so joyful and exciting and gave it its place in the whole song.

The introduction really translate the melancholic side of the song until the brass section enters in a psychedelic explosion which sends you directly back to the 60's (or what I imagine the 60's to be).

California Dreamin' is one of the songs with the most occurrences in my playlist but I think this version is by far my favorite.
