<h2>Cool covers</h2>
<p>When I was a teenager and I started actively listen to a lot of music and exploring my tastes, one thing I would
    always be adamant about was how cover songs were <em>the worst</em>. I think I was mostly trying to show everybody
    how vast and impressive my musical knowledge was and what a better way would there be than dismissing a song someone
    likes &quot;because the original is so much better&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Sorry Jeff Buckley, Leonard Cohen was so much better!<br>
        How did Nirvana dare singing &quot;The man who saved the world&quot;, what an insult to Bowie??<br>
        What? How can't you know that &quot;Sing for the moment&quot; is from Aerosmith, not Eminem ðŸ™„</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately I grew up and got <em>a little</em> less dumb. I realized that making a cover of a song is an amazing
    exercise of creativity and sure enough I developed <s>a weird obsession</s> a wild interest in cover songs (take
    that teenage me). I love to see how some artists are able to take a song and transform it completely using their own
    universe to make something entirely new. The history of covered songs are also sometimes completely fascinating: How
    many times have I realized that this song I've been listening for years is actually a cover of an obscure band which
    never reached success?</p>
<p>That's how on June 2018 I created my &quot;Cool Covers&quot; playlist on Spotify, I compile in it the covers that I
    like and I usually try to learn a thing or two about this History of music. The playlist contains well known covers,
    some more obscure ones, some songs which subtly sample parts of others and sometimes original songs that I thought
    were covers.</p>

<p>In this page I'll try to write a little bit about my favorite ones, or the ones I find the more interesting. I'm not
    sure how long I'll manage to keep it updated but we'll see!</p>
