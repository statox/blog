title: Dubber side of the moon - Easy Start All-Stars vs. Pink Floyd
---

Some of the first albums I discovered on Spotify were the compilations "Dub side of the moon" and "Dubber side of the moon" by the reggae collective [Easy Star All-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Star_All-Stars).

As you would have never guessed from the title, this is a tribute to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the moon. The collective pushed the tribute as far as publishing the instructions to synchronize the album with the movie Wizard of Oz from 1939 like Pink Floyd's fan have been doing with the original album.

In this album I especially enjoy Brain Damage, which is I dare to say, at least as good as the original song with its echoed voices and its rhythm section which makes you happily bounce your shoulders.
