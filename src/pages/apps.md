## Stuff I use

At one point I got limited by the fact that this blog is statically generated and was getting in the way of the helper apps I was creating for myself.

So I setup [apps.statox.fr](https://apps.statox.fr) which is a collection of web app powered by [SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev/) I made for my own use. They are probably not useful to any one else than me but have a look you might find something interesting.

For example this blog used to have a `/notes` page which I used to take notes of various commands and code snippets I found convenient to have available, this page now lives [here](https://apps.statox.fr/notes). I also moved [my songbook](https://apps.statox.fr/songbook) over there and I keep this collection of apps growing.
