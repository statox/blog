#### ZVEX Instant LoFi Junky

_TODO: Turn that into images and come up with my own sample settings. Current settings taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c843sYNem0E)._

**Compressed signal only** Comp/Lofi at 0%.

**Pure Vibrato** Comp/Lofi at 100%

**Mellow Chorus** All pots at 50%

**Brighter Chorus with commpressed signal**

- Volume: 60%
- Speed: 60%
- Comp/Lofi: 40%
- Tone: 100%
- Depth: 60%

Important part here is the `Tone` pot. Up: Let high cuts through. Down: Mellow things out.
