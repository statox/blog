### Hello

I am Adrien Fabre (aka statox), a server software engineer at [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) in Paris, France.

This website is just a place for me to talk a bit about my side projects and keep a few notes for myself.
My plan is to talk about the topics that I like (in no particular order): Vim, Linux and system administration, doing fun simulations in the browser, DIY projects, improving people's privacy on the internet and software development in general.

You can contact me at <code>me AT statox DOT fr</code> if you want to.

### Technology on this site

#### Analytics

Because I want to be able to know how many people read my rambling I use an analytics platform on this website.

However I think the fight for a more privacy friendly internet is one of the most important to lead currently. That's why I use [goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/): It is a privacy friendly tool which does nothing else than counting how many time my pages are loaded. So no cookie :cookie: for you on this site, nor any other invasive tracking method.

#### Web

My professional experience is mainly focused on backend development: That's what I like and what interests me the most. So when I started creating a website I wanted it to be dead simple so that I get things done quickly and without friction. That's why I chose to use [eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) a simpler static site generator.

And as I'm not exactly a css expert and wanted something simpler than bootstrap I went with [newcss](https://newcss.net/) a very simple css framework.

The source code of the site is [on Github](https://github.com/statox/blog/) and uses [travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/) to automatically build and publish each update.
