## Hello

I am Adrien Fabre (aka statox), a server software engineer at [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) in Paris, France.

This website is just a place for me to talk a bit about my side projects and keep a few notes for myself.
My plan is to talk about the topics that I like (in no particular order): Vim, Linux and system administration, doing fun simulations in the browser, DIY projects, improving people's privacy on the internet and software development in general.

You can contact me at <code>me AT statox DOT fr</code> if you want to.
