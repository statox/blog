When I'm coding I listen to music and when I'm not coding I try to play some music. In these pages I try to keep useful or interesting resources I have gathered from my researches.

## [Chords](/chords/)

A list of song chords I took from the internet or made by myself and like to play.

## [Guitar](/guitar/)

I've been playing the guitar for 10+ years now but I had never made the efforts to learn music theory properly until recently.
[Music theory and guitar practice page](/guitar/)

## [Pedals](/pedals/)

Sometimes I play my guitar with a pedalboard I'm putting together. Here I keep some user manuals, some sample settings and probaly more stuff in the future.

## [Cool covers](/coolcovers/)

One of my weird obsession is cover songs. I try to write a bit about my discoveries.
