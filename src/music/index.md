When I'm coding I listen to music and when I'm not coding I try to play some music.

## [Cool covers](/coolcovers/)

One of my weird obsession is cover songs. I try to write a bit about my discoveries [on the cool covers page](/coolcovers/)

## [Guitar](/guitar/)

I've been playing the guitar for 10+ years now but I had never made the efforts to learn music theory properly until recently. I keep some useful resources [on this page](/guitar/)

## [Chords](/chords/)

A list of chords I took from the internet and like to play: [Chords page](/chords/)
