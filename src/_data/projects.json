As there is no API I went with a rust application which screenshots the game, check some pixels in the bottom right corner to parse the current speed and which presses some keys on the keyboard to control the car. For now the bot is able to maintain the car at a given speed by pressing and releasing the up arrow key. The next step is to do some ray tracing to detect the borders of the track."
