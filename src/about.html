<h2>Hello</h2>

<p>
    I am Adrien Fabre (aka statox), a server software engineer at <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a> in Paris, France.
</p>
<p>
    This website is just a place for me to talk a bit about my side projects and keep a few notes for myself. I hope to be able to post regularly... we will see if that happens.
    <br/>
    My plan is to talk about the topics that I like (in no particular order): Vim, Linux and system administration, doing fun simulations in the browser, DIY projects, improving people's privacy on the internet and software development in general.
</p>
<p>
    You can contact me at <code>me AT statox DOT fr</code> if you want to.
</p>
