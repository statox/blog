        <h3>Hello</h3>
<p>I am Adrien Fabre (aka statox), a server software engineer at <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dashlane</a> in Paris, France.</p>
<p>This website is just a place for me to talk a bit about my side projects and keep a few notes for myself.<br>
My plan is to talk about the topics that I like (in no particular order): Vim, Linux and system administration, doing fun simulations in the browser, DIY projects, improving people's privacy on the internet and software development in general.</p>
<p>You can contact me at <code>me AT statox DOT fr</code> if you want to.</p>
<h3>Technology on this site</h3>
<h4>Analytics</h4>
<p>Because I want to be able to know how many people read my rambling I use an analytics platform on this website.</p>
<p>However I think the fight for a more privacy friendly internet is one of the most important to lead currently. That's why I use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goatcounter</a>: It is a privacy friendly tool which does nothing else than counting how many time my pages are loaded. So no cookie for you on this site, nor any other invasive tracking method.</p>
<h4>Web</h4>
<p>My professional experience is mainly focused on backend development: That's what I like and what interest me the most. So when I started creating a website I wanted it to be dead simple so that I don't have to spend too much time on topics which are not my main passion. That's why I chose to use <a href="https://11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eleventy</a> a simpler static site generator.</p>
<p>And as I'm not exactly a css expert and wanted something simpler than bootstrap I went with <a href="https://newcss.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newcss</a> a very simple css framework</p>
<p>The source code of the site is <a href="https://github.com/statox/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Github</a> and uses <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travis ci</a> to automatically build and publish each update.</p>
